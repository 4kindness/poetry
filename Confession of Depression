Confession of Depression

At times, the days unravel as I submerge 
in nebulous bullshit, thick with blocks 
of pain, panic, and odd behavior. Odd 
like an ill-fitted suit or a lone seven-foot man 
in a crowd of midgets, eyelids 
glued shut — so as to be 
unnoticed. Such a silly aspiration 
 
for such a tall man. At times, I surface 
briefly to breathe. More often to eat,
to disguise inside, stuffing to discomfort 
to evoke disgust — whose I am unsure. I glue 
to a string of TV plots slotted 

into moments like partitions of a maze 
in which I immerse 
immense in feigned living. Periodically, I drift 
into semiconscious sleep to dream 
a life that smolders into unmemorable mist. 
I feel and I numb 
 
the scream — help me! — uttered mutely 
and my assertion of a universe without ears. Deaf 
to self, I nurture hunger and wounds 
inside an emptiness to immeasurable 
breadth surpassing 
stupidity. In an inhospitable 
home, in an unappealing, ill-cared-for 
body, I hide
 
desire as though I can still it. Still, I cannot 
still the longing 
to intimately intermingle 
my heart with those of others 
who, in honesty, matter to me. I shut out all 
I can and still with cyclic regularity
I break 
 
promises and agreements 
to more than a few. And the fuck-you 
stench is undeniable and the rudeness
drips acid-sweat stripping off my newly-formed skin 
layer after layer. While I live 
imbalanced, alone, 
seeking. My story 
is boring 
 
a hole into my soul and it sucks 
me into black avoid. Oddly, 
there is a lot about me to like 
and I genuinely like a lot. My laughter 
transcends — for it would be silly to weigh 
myself as a measure of who 
I am. Closeup 
 
reveals all the imperfections 
of the skin, clearly — as just another 
wrinkled suit — as all that I am easily rolls 
up into clumpy layers, tattered
by unbearable moments melted
by invisible welts from walls, Still,
an onion always peels off
until nothing. I still end up dead
 
weight at the end of my own rope
like a pendulum at the mercy
of inertia in frictionless void, swinging
by the threads I live, by
my choices — twisted
into twine, etched into the skin
of my neck — choking
me. Am I not
 
proud to own this palette of decisions 
with which I carve how I am 
out of this life? Am I not shamed
by the sight of me? I question 
validity and integrity 
in the inner conflict that ticks 
and talks between safety 
and free. At my core, looming

fear and dearly held values: truth
and honesty, generosity and kindness, 
freedom and involvement, and 
a question — where 
does safety lie 
in this hierarchy of mine that defines 
me? At my worst, stilled hesitation,


wistfully indulging
in and in truly wondering
whether to yield or wield
the incisive blade to cut
my rope to bleed me
finally free; so contrary
and so unlike the momentary 

bliss of the pierce or sear of my skin
so as to be elsewhere. So uncertain 
of what to make of me; so I hang 
cleansing, freely
grasping
onto glued eyelids, searching
for change, hoping I am blind 
to the key to reality:
 
Inevitable defeat. I want to live 
with integrity. Tenaciously, 
I bet on possibilities: do I 
see on some days or do I not
on so many others? Still, 
perpetually persisting, I cloak
in nakedness,
in genuine, and in laughter,
always daunted as I unravel
with every breath I breathe.
